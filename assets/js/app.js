    <h3>A case for why</h3>
    <p>I want to start this off by saying how much I value my bootcamp experience
    and that I don't regret any part of my decision to commit to the fulltime
    immersive program. While I certainly struggled with the decision, and for several
    years honestly, it was almost entirely due to my financial situation. Bootcamp,
    like all school frankly, is 80% about what you put into and a lesser 20% based
    on the actual curriculum or the support group that is involved. That being said,
    I think there are a few things that could be expanded with curriculum examples
    that could drastically improve absorption and understanding of core
    comptencies.
    </p>
    <h3>Know your Audience</h3>
    <p>The reality is that perceived 'simple' examples for experts are fairly
    confusing for newer entrants to the devlopment medium. I for one, have
    several years of prior experience where I learned both C++ and Java.
    However, even with that background I've struggled with taking examples
    and building on top of them with other concepts.  </p>
    <p>Moreover, generaly logic is vastly different than programming logic.
    Any person who is switching careers, say from a non-business profession
    will be at fairly significant disadvantage. There is a common theme in
    reporting that there are significant STEM jobs but not enough qualified
    applicants. An important step in filling those gaps is creating an environment
    for people to learn those skills, and it shouldn't be reserved for just young
    students.</p>
    <p>With these ideas in mind, a 'novice' approach would be to break
    examples down even further and generate a hand-holding approach that could
    help older entrants with the core building blocks for development.</p>
    <h3>A few examples</h3>
    <p>There are several good resources that get most of the way there
    but they are not friendly for newbies. <br/><span>
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map'
    target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, <br/></span>
    <span><a href='https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp'
    target='_blank'>W3Schools</a>, <br/></span>
    <span><a href='https://medium.com/front-end-hacking/understanding-async-await-c9a267e2d96d'
    target='_blank'>Async/Await Blog Post</a>, </span>
    </p>
    <p>All of the above resources have contributors who, in many cases,
    have spent many hours and resources on building out strong examples, but
    when it comes to creating tutorials for aspiring technologists from liberal arts
    or more verbal professions creating actual examples with real examples and not someFunc()<br/>
    <strong>Poor Example:</strong>
    <pre style='background-color: #efefef; font-family: Source Code Pro, monospace; font-size: 15px;'>
      async function someTask() {
      // this will execute some task
      console.log('this will print second');
      }
      await function someOtherTask(){
      // this will execute some other task
      console.log('this will print 1st');
      }
    </pre>
    Can you discern what is actually going on with the example above? There have been so many
    times when I've been trying to implement someone elses example where my usecase is subtely
    different. The problem arises when the example is so generic it becomes hard to grasp
    the proper context of how the solution can be modified. This just exacerbates your
    frustration as a newer developer because you just have enough experience to pickup most
    context clues.
